### `sf` Object Properties

An `sf` object is a fancy `data.frame` with extra propeties.  Here are all the recognized methods that you can use with these objects.

```{r}
methods(class="sf")
```

As you see, you can use the square braket and dollar sign notation just for `data.frames`

```{r}
structures <- st_read("data/structures.shp")
box <- st_bbox(structures)
box
```
