```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("setup.R")
```

Visualizing data contained in a raster is a fundamental task that can be handled by many different conditions.  For this example, we will use the Baja California elevation raster.


```{r}
library(raster)
r <- raster("data/alt_22.tif")
baja_california <- crop(r, extent( c(-115,-109,22,30) ) )
baja_california
```



## Basic Plotting

As part of the built-in object, a `raster` has the following methods available.

```{r}
methods(class="raster")
```

of which the plot is the most relevant for this page. 

```{r}
plot(baja_california)
```

This is the normal plotting functions so we can fancy it up using the normal kind of options to the plot command:

```{r}
plot( baja_california, 
      xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude",
      main = "Elevation for Baja California",
      col=terrain.colors(50) )
```

## Rasters & `ggplot`

You can also use `ggplot` to plot your rasters using `geom_tile`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame( rasterToPoints( baja_california )) 
names(df) <- c("Longitude","Latitude","Elevation")
p <- ggplot( df ) + geom_tile( aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude,fill=Elevation)) 
p <- p + scale_fill_gradientn( colors=c('#a6611a','#dfc27d','#f5f5f5','#80cdc1','#018571'))
p <- p + coord_equal() + xlab("Longitude") + ylab("Latitude") 
p
```




## 3-Dimensional Visualization

It is also possible to visualize rasters in 3-space.  The library `rasterVis` provides an interface to the `rgl` library to plot a surface.  Once installed, these are easy to use for viewing surfaces. Here is an example using the elevation data we have been playing with.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(rasterVis)
plot3D( baja_california , zfac=0.1)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Baja_Plot3D.png")
```

The `zfac` option in the plot is the amount to scale the z-axis (elevation) in relation to the x-axis and y-axis dimensions.  It is a bit exaggerated at `zfac=0.1` but you get the idea.

this is some new stuff
