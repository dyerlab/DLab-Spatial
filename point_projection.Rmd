title: "Projecting Points"
---


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("setup.R")
```


Our points represent some locale(s) on the earth (or other exoplanet) and we need to them to identify and perhaps change the projection.  See the general discussion on [projections](projections.html) for more background.

## The Data

Here we will use the enigmatic *Araptus attenuata* data set as a raw `data.frame`

```{r}
library(scape)
data("araptus")
araptus_sf <- st_as_sf(araptus,coords = c("Longitude","Latitude"))
araptus_sf
```

## Setting a CRS

For R to understand what the coordinate data mean, they need to be specified in terms of a Coordinate Reference System.

```{r}
st_crs(araptus_sf) <- 3857
araptus_sf
```
